 This project contains the full Android app project of my submission as the final assignment of Coursera's [Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-app). This Android app is an enhanced version of the Miles to Kilomete Converter app that was developed throughout the earlier parts of the course.
